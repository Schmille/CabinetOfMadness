# Doctor Schmille's Cabinet of madness!
Welcome and enjoy your stay!

### What even is this?
This mod is what I would consider a "kitchen sink" mod. In other words: This mod is a collection of disconnected concepts,
jokes and things I generally find entertaining.

If you want a serious mod with actual use cases, you might want to look somewhere else.

Should you (for whatever reason) want to use this, you will require Minecraft Forge version 1.18.1-39.1.0.
You can build this mod by cloning this repository and run `gradlew build`.

Have fun.
